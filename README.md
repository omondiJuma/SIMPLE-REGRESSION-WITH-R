On this repository I have two csv data files that I used to test simple regression with R. One file is for fuel prices where I tested the effect of crude oil on the fuel price.

The other CSV file I created it. I recorded my screen time and sleep hours to excel. The aim was to see if screen time has an effect on the hours of sleep I get.

I am working to interpret the regression results ......will soon post them.
